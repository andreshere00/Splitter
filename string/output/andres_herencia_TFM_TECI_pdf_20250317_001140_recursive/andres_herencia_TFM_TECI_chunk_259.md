and E a target sentence E =

⟨e1, . . . , eI⟩ = e|E|
, where each fj with j = 1, . . . , J is a position-wised word from the
1
source or input sentence and each ei with i = 1, . . . , I is a position-wised word from the
target or output sequence. Thus, any translation system type can be seen as a function

ˆE = MT(F ),
