Theoretical background

Efficient and accurate text transformation tasks have long been a goal in machine design.
The Transformer architecture has addressed this challenge. However, its development
has relied on prior architectures. This chapter outlines the architectures enabling the
emergence of the Transformer and upcoming LLM.
