Context
I know that I need to get past my
feelings for this person I fell in love
with, but it’s so difficult to move
on because he showed me feelings
I’ve never felt before. I feel like I
don’t want to be without my
genuine love for him, but logically,
I know I need to be without him. I
can’t discuss this with anybody in
my life because the conditions
surrounding our love are
considered "wrong" by a lot of
people. How can I get myself to
just move on?
