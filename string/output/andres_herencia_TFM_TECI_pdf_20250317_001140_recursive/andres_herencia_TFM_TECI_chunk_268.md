However, they have some disadvantages. These architectures sometimes do not al-
low capturing dependencies between distant words, resulting in a slower training pace
(computational complexity). Another cell-based architecture raised trying to solve this
problem, such as GRU units, which can be found on appendices (D), but its performance
was similar to the LSTM cells.
