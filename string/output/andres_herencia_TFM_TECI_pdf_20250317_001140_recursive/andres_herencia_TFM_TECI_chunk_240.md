The difference between each response is quantified in Table 6.5, which presents various
metrics: vocabulary size (number of unique tokens in the generated responses), average
length, minimum length, and maximum length of the responses, in tokens. The fine-tuned
model exhibits slightly enhanced linguistic diversity than the original model, even richer

than the reference response. However, it has been associated with a greater variation in
response size.
