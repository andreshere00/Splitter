Output Layer

Figure 2.1: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) structure diagram.

The neurons are described as the minimal computational unit in a neural network.
Each neuron computes the output as a weighted sum of the input data processed by a
non-linear function. The connections module the weights of each neuronâ€™s relations. In
Figure 2.1, a neural network with an input layer with three neurons, two hidden layers
with five and four neurons, and an output layer with two neurons is shown.
