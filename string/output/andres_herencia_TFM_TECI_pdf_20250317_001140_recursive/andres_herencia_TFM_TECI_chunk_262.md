Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Cell

The Long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture comprises the two following elements:
(i) the cell, the main element, which is responsible for preserving the dependencies between
input data for any time interval; and (ii) the gates, which relate input, output, hidden
cells, and states between each other. [67]
