The present project aims to modify an existing LLM to provide expert knowledge in
the mental health counseling domain. This model will be tailored to provide support
and guidance in mental health scenarios. Subsequently, its performance will be compared
with the original model to evaluate the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process. State-of-
the-art LLM customization techniques will be reviewed, as well as the priorly introduced
architectures before the irruption of the Transformer model.
