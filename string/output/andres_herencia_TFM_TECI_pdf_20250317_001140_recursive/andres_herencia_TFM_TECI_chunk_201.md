method [65]. Although these techniques, combined with efficient test-training set parti-
tions and an adequate evaluation of the model perform well, it could be challenging to ex-
ecute in Deep Learning models and concretely, in Large Language Models. Consequently,
the hyper-parameters search has been conducted iteratively based on experimental results
and expert knowledge disclosed on the Internet. [52] [17] [46]
