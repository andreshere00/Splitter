Some fine-tuning techniques include: (i) additive, adding extra parameters to the pre-
trained model; (ii) partial, selecting a reduced number of the original model parameters;
(iii) re-parametrized, introducing additional low-rank trainable parameters; (iv) full, re-
training the entire model; and (v) hybrid, combining multiple techniques [66].
