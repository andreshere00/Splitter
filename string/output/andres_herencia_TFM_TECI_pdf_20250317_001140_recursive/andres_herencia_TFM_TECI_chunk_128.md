In the foundational paper [61], the initial linear transformation maps data into a vector
space of dimension 2048, df f = 4Ã—dmodel = 2048. Although the linear transformations are
consistent across different positions, they vary in parameters from one layer to another.
This process is analogous to applying two convolutional layers with a unitary kernel size.
