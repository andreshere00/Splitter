The input of this block at time step t is represented as xt = (x1, x2, . . . , xN), while
2 , . . . , z(e)
N ). Referring to the encoder-decoder
the output is denoted as zt
notation, this vector can take the same role as the encoding vector h(e)
. Note that the
t
inputs can be either a vector or a matrix, depending on the modelâ€™s specific task. In text
transformation tasks, these are vectors.
