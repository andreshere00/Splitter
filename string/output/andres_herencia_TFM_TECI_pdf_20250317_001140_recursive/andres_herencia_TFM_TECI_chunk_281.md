However, this coding has an important limitation: encoding the characteristics in
binary does not allow capturing the degree or order in which a token has a feature. Does
dron have the same degree of sky feature as bee? Furthermore, it does not guarantee
that the words are univocally decodable from the rest. If the word goose is added to this
feature space, what distinguishes it from bee? Observe Table E.2.
