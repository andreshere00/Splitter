Due to the hardness of creating a semantic relationship model, pre-trained embedding
models are typically used. Two of the most famous and foundational algorithms are
Word2Vec [41] and Glove [47] (published in 2014, when the first s2s models based on
RNN appeared). Still, there are other newly models, such as Mistral or MiniLM .
