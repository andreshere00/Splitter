This architecture encounters multiple challenges, including information bottlenecks
(resulting from fixed-length vector representations), difficulties in managing long sequences,
and issues with aligning input and output sequences, which stem from the architectureâ€™s
origins in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) models, among other problems. Atten-
tion mechanisms alleviate these issues by enabling selective focus on different parts of the
