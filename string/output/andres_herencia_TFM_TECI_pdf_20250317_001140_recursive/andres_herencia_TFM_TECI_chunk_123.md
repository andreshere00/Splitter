By preventing future position information from influencing the prediction of the cur-
rent position, the model adheres to the causal structure required for generating text or
other sequence outputs sequentially. Indeed, this states autoregressive capabilities in the
architecture, being useful for tasks in the Time Series Analysis (TSA) context. [63]
