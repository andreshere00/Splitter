Consider the following example: Suppose an embedding model with dimension d = 6 and
maximum token length posmax = 10. Now, as extracted from the expression F.1, the even
indices i will be encoded by the sine function; meanwhile, the odd indices by the cosine
function. If both indices are stacked based on the position and sorting indices, results
from Table F.1 are obtained.
