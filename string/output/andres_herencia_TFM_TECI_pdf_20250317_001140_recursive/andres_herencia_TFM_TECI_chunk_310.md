important to remember that you
donâ€™t have to do this alone, and
that there are people and resources
available to help you. Take some
time and space for yourself, talk to
someone you trust, and remember
to be kind to yourself. With time
and support, you can move on
from these feelings and find
happiness and fulfillment in other
areas of your life.
