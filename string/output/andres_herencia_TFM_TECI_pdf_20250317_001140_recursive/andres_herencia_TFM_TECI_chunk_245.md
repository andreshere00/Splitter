Despite this, the over-trained model outperforms the vanilla model in the evaluation
metrics, with greater contextual richness and without compromising inference time (in
fact, it is shorter, as the average response length is reduced and re-parameterization
introduced minimal delay). To sum up, the fine-tuned model exhibits better results, at
the cost of a complex and arduous iterative training and a model selection process.
