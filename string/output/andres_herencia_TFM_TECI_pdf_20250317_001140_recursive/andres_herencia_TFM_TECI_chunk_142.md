where x is the input (a vector or tensor), W is the weight matrix applied beforehand Swish
function application, V is the weight matrix used for the element-wised multiplication
(denoted by ⊗) at the Swish function’s output, b and c are the bias terms, and β is a
specific parameter of the Swish activation function which adjusts the non-linear effect
weight. It can process terms close to 0 as slightly negative or positive terms, rather than
