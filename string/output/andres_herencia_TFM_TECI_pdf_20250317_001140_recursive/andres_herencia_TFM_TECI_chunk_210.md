• lr_scheduler_type: parameter which specifies the learning rate scheduler type
used. [37] Specifies how the learning rate gradually decreases from the value raised
after the warm-up period. This function allows a smooth decay in the learning rate,
avoiding abrupt changes in that parameter.

• num_training_epochs: represents the number of passes through the training
dataset. While a low value could cause under-fitting, a high value can lead to
over-fitting.
