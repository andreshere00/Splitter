Transformers are fundamentally based on Deep Learning (DL) models, so knowing about
neural networks is mandatory. A neural network is a computational architecture used in
statistical learning tasks. Every neural network is characterized by three elements: (i) the
neurons; (ii) the connections; and (iii) the layers. There are three main layers: the input
layer, the output layer, and the hidden layers (can be more than one). [62]
