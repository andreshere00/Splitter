5.3.2 METEOR Score

Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit Ordering (METEOR) score is employed
to evaluate the quality of the generated responses.

recall, and harmonic mean (F1 score), and incorporates several linguistic features, such
as stemming, synonymy matching, and paraphrase matching, to provide a more nuanced
evaluation of the generated text.
