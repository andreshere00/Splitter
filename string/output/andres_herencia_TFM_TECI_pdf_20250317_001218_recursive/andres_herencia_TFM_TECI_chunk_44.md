• Computational resources refer to the necessary hardware and software. For
building, fine-tuning, and evaluating LLMs, Python and its libraries are used. Due
to the computational complexity of these models, virtual machines provided by the
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)1 and Google Colab2 are employed.

• Mental health conversation data is gathered from diverse sources, then trans-

formed and loaded into public repositories.
