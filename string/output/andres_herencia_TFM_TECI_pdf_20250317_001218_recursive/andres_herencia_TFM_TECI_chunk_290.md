4. Lemma identification: Using linguistic rules and/or dictionaries, the correspond-
ing lemma is searched for each word according to its grammatical category and its
inflected form. For example, for the verb "drinking", the lemma would be "drink";
for the noun "dogs", the lemma would be "dog".

5. Normalization: All instances of a word are replaced by its corresponding lemma.
