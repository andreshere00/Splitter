Observe the example in Figure E.1 [16]. The previously mentioned features are rep-
resented in that space: wings, sky, and engine. Words are positioned in that space
based on how related they are to their characteristics. Thus, helicopter, drone, and rocket
are related by sky and engine, but in a different degree. Analogously to the words in
red, goose, eagle and bee. Meanwhile, jet can be described with all the features.
