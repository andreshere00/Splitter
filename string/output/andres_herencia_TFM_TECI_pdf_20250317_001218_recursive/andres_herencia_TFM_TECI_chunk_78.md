2.3.2 Training

Encoder-decoder architecture can be trained using Back-Propagation Through Time (BPTT),
as is common with other architectures. Regularization techniques such as mini-batch pro-
cessing [35], gradient clipping [68], and early stopping are often utilized to ease training
and prevent overfitting. Another common algorithm is the Bidirectional Backward Prop-
agation (B-BP) method, as explained in the following section. [53]
