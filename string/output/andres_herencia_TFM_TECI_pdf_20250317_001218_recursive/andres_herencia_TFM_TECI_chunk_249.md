Before fine-tuning, the data has been studiously processed, cleaned and transformed
into the format in which the model has been pre-trained. The main fine-tuning hyper-
parameters have been selected based on empirical results and conducting previous analy-
ses. Due to the limitation of the computational resources, the model has been quantified
and the QLoRA PEFT method was finally applied.
