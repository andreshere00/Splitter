2.3. ENCODER-DECODER ARCHITECTURE

2.2.2 Training

Several training methods are used in this architecture. Most of them are supervised
learning methods based on the gradient descent algorithm: Real-Time Recurrent Learn-
ing (RTRL), Recurrent Back-Propagation (RBP), or Back-Propagation Through Time
(BPTT). [9] The latter is probably the most used one.
