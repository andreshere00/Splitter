Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning involves re-training part or all of a model to adapt it to a new task or domain.
This process may involve freezing specific layers (e.g., transformer, fully connected, or
attention layers), leaving their weights unchanged while training the remaining layers.
Typically, the final layers capture complex, domain-specific relationships, whereas the
initial layers retain the most elementary relationships between input elements.
