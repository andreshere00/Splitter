Transfer learning (TL) is a neural network technique where knowledge acquired during
training for one task is used to enhance performance on a related task (see Figure 4.3)
[70]. For example, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify cat pictures
can be used to categorize lynx pictures. This technique is widely applied in CNNs but can
also be applied to other ANN architectures. Sometimes, the model adapts correctly to the
