Therefore, the architecture was adapted so that the network sends information to and
from any of its hidden layers in the training phase. This adaptation founded a new neural
network scheme, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). [39]

2.2 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNN is a popular architecture for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as
translation, text processing, or sentiment analysis.
