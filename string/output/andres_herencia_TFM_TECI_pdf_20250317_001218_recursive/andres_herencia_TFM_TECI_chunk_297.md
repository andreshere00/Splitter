Indeed, for every sine-cosine pair with frequency ωk there is a linear transformation

M ∈ R2×2 (not dependant of t) such that:

(cid:34)

M ·

sin (ωk · t)
cos (ωk · t)

(cid:35)

(cid:34)

=

sin (ωk · (t + ϕ))
cos (ωk · (t + ϕ))

(cid:35)

Therefore, for some positions, ⃗pt ≡ ⃗pt+1. So, effectively, the model can learn to attend
by relative positions, because those vectors are well-known in previous or subsequent
positions.
