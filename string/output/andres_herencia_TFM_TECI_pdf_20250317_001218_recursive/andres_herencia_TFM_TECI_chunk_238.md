LLaMA’s method of structuring outputs. The original model has been pre-trained on
a supervised dataset with easily recognizable patterns (refer to section 5.1.4). Given the
significant influence of the pre-training dataset on the model’s parameters, it is challenging
for the model to generate responses with syntax and grammar that align closely with those
provided by humans.
