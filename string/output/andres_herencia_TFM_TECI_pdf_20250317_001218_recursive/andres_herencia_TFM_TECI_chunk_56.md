weights are updated.

Since the output is binary, the system will converge when the expected output equals
the computed output, yd = y [19]. Therefore, this method can only be applied to linear-
separable classification problems.

To deal with this constraint, more neurons and layers can be aggregated to capture
complex relationships. [49] These are arranged in the three layers mentioned above (sec-
tion 2.1), and they build a machine known as a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
