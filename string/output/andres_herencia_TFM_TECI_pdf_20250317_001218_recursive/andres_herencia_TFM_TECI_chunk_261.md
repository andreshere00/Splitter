where θ are the model parameters that specify the probability distribution. [45] In that
process, input and output sentences must be aligned to obtain correspondence between
words.
In addition, lexicon data are passed to the model to learn the probability dis-
tribution. So, the θ parameters of the Bayesian model are learned. Indeed, it could be
understood as an encoding-decoding process, but not in the way exposed in section 2.3.
Observe Figure B.1.
