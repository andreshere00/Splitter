The Transformer computes the correlation between queries and keys through the at-
tention scoring or the compatibility function f . A compatibility function is a non-linear
application expected to compute the similarity or correlation between input arguments.
Additionally, it is searched to have high computational efficiency and normalization mech-
anisms (e.g., via an activation function).
