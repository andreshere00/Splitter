The test is performed at a significance level of α = 0.05. With a correlation coefficient of
0.3605 and a p-value of 4.61 × 10−59, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis, which
posits that views and upvotes are independent. Therefore, there is no need to weight the
responses based on upvotes, as this could introduce bias. Figure 5.1 illustrates the upvotes
distribution in subfigure 5.1a and a scatter plot of views versus upvotes in subfigure 5.1b.
