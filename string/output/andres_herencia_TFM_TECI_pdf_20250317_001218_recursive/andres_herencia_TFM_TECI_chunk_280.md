For example, suppose a vector space of three features: wings, engine, and sky. In
this space, for the word bee, the characteristics of wings and sky are identified, but not
motor. Thus, in a supposed 3-feature vector space, the word could be encoded as [1 0
1]. On the other hand, the word drone could be identified as [0 1 1], since it has a
motor and flies, but does not have wings. Observe Table E.1.
