The GRUâ€™s simplified structure offers some advantages over the LSTM, including fewer
parameters and a more straightforward implementation, which leads to faster training
time without a significant compromise in performance. [11] It can be seen as a mid-term
between the classic RNN architecture and the LSTM cells.
