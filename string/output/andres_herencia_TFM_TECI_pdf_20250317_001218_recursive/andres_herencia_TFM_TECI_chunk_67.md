where WHH is the weights matrix for the connections between the previous hidden
state htâˆ’1 and the subsequent (current) hidden state ht; WIH is the weights matrix for
the connections between the current input xt and the hidden state. WHO is the weights
matrix for the connections between the last layer of the hidden state and the output layer.
Finally, bh and bo are the bias vectors for the hidden state and the last layer; and fH
